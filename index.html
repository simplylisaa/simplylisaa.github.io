    <h1>My Submissive Bio for Potential Mistresses</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>What I want between us</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I’m looking for an ongoing, long-term Mistress.</strong>
          <p>Not a one-off scene: I want a relationship where trust, control, and care grow over time.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I’m secretly auditioning you as a Mistress.</strong>
          <p>I notice consistency, presence, and whether you truly make me want to submit.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When we’re done</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aftercare is important to me, whether chatting, reflecting on it, ...</strong>
          <p>I need a soft landing after play — talking, cuddling, or a quiet check-in helps me feel safe and connected.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How you treat me</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I want you to be loving/rough/gentle/strict/demanding with me.</strong>
          <p>I enjoy a shifting dynamic as long as you remain confident and in control.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I want you to praise me. Tell me I’m beautiful / strong / sexy.</strong>
          <p>Your words matter; I want to feel seen and admired when I’ve earned it.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Make me earn your approval.</strong>
          <p>Don’t give praise away — let it be a reward I must work for.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I need you to be always confident and in control.</strong>
          <p>I thrive with a steady, unshakable presence.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I need to see your human side.</strong>
          <p>Little glimpses of warmth make trust deeper, even when you’re in command.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I like nicknames.</strong>
          <p>Being called a special name — sweet, strict, or humiliating — deepens my feeling of being yours.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What happens in my head</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I want to feel beautiful / vulnerable / safe / loved / desired.</strong>
          <p>These emotions are why I submit; they make scenes meaningful for me.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I don’t want to know what’s coming next.</strong>
          <p>Surprise heightens anticipation and keeps me focused on you.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Pain</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I want pain that is predictable and manageable.</strong>
          <p>Controlled, expected intensity that grounds me without overwhelming.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dominance and submission</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I want to submit to you voluntarily.</strong>
          <p>My surrender should feel chosen, not coerced.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Tell me what to do with your words.</strong>
          <p>Clear commands help me focus and sink deeper into submission.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I want to be a good girl.</strong>
          <p>Pleasing you matters to me; I want to hear when I’ve done well.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I want an ongoing D/s connection with you.</strong>
          <p>I want continuity — a thread that runs between us even outside scenes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Put a collar and/or leash on me.</strong>
          <p>Tangible symbols of ownership make submission feel real and anchored.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How you feel about me</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I want you to be proud of me.</strong>
          <p>Your pride is the reward I want to earn.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I want to feel safe/owned/vulnerable with you.</strong>
          <p>Those emotions are the heart of my submission.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I want to be your prized possession.</strong>
          <p>I want to be cherished, valued, and undeniably yours.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Punishment and training</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I want to work for your approval, knowing that I only get it if I succeed.</strong>
          <p>Approval should feel earned, not given.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Train me!</strong>
          <p>I want guidance, corrections, and structure that shape me into the submissive you desire.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I like rules, protocols, and rituals.</strong>
          <p>Routines and rituals keep me anchored and remind me of you even when we’re apart.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Your disapproval/disappointment would be painful and damaging to me.</strong>
          <p>Emotional consequences weigh heavily; I want to avoid failing you.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Be fair with me.</strong>
          <p>I can take strictness if your rules and punishments are consistent and just.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Begging and vulnerability</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Make me ask / beg for what I want.</strong>
          <p>Voicing desire or pleading deepens the power exchange and feels intensely real.</p></li>
      </ul>
