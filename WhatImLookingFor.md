# What I'm looking for

## What I want between us
* **I'm looking for an ongoing, long-term Mistress.**
  * Not a one-off scene: I want a relationship where trust, control, and care grow over time.
* **I'm secretly auditioning you as a Mistress.**
  * I notice consistency, presence, and whether you truly make me want to submit.

## When we're done
* **Aftercare is important to me, whether chatting, reflecting on it, ...**
  * I need a soft landing after play — talking, cuddling, or a quiet check-in helps me feel safe and connected.

## How you treat me
* **I want you to be loving/rough/gentle/strict/demanding with me.**
  * I enjoy a shifting dynamic as long as you remain confident and in control.
* **I want you to praise me. Tell me I'm beautiful / strong / sexy.**
    * Your words matter; I want to feel seen and admired when I've earned it.
* **Make me earn your approval.**
  * Don't give praise away — let it be a reward I must work for.
* **I need you to be always confident and in control.**
* **I need to see your human side.**
* **I like nicknames.**
  * Being called a special name deepens my feeling of being yours.

## What happens in my head
* **I want to feel beautiful / vulnerable / safe / loved / desired.**
  * These emotions are why I submit; they make scenes meaningful for me.
* **I don't want to know what's coming next.**
  * Surprise heightens anticipation and keeps me focused on you.

## Pain
* **I want pain that is predictable and manageable.**
  * Controlled, expected intensity that grounds me without overwhelming.

## Dominance and submission
* **I want to submit to you voluntarily.**
  * My surrender should feel chosen, not coerced.
* **Tell me what to do with your words.**
  * Clear commands help me focus and sink deeper into submission.
* **I want to be a good girl.**
  * Pleasing you matters to me; I want to hear when I've done well.
* **I want an ongoing D/s connection with you.**
  * I want continuity — a thread that runs between us even outside scenes.
* **Put a collar and/or leash on me.**

## How you feel about me
* **I want you to be proud of me.**
  * Your pride is the reward I want to earn.
* **I want to feel safe/owned/vulnerable with you.**
  * Those emotions are the heart of my submission.
* **I want to be your prized possession.**
  * I want to be cherished, valued, and undeniably yours.

## Punishment and training
* **I want to work for your approval, knowing that I only get it if I succeed.**
  * Approval should feel earned, not given.
* **Train me!**
  * I want guidance, corrections, and structure that shape me into the submissive you desire.
* **I like rules, protocols, and rituals.**
  * Routines and rituals keep me anchored and remind me of you even when we're apart.
* **Your disapproval/disappointment would be painful and damaging to me.**
  * Emotional consequences weigh heavily; I want to avoid failing you.
* **Be fair with me.**
  * I can take strictness if your rules and punishments are consistent and just.

## Begging and vulnerability
* **Make me ask / beg for what I want.**
  * Voicing desire or pleading deepens the power exchange and feels intensely real.
